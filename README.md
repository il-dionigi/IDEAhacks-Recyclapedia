###**Our IDEA** 

Keeping our world clean and healthy is important, even more-so now that there are so many people who are seemingly treating it as if it was disposable. Our product would serve to both educate and incentivize people to recycle items as it is basically an encyclopedia for all things recyclable. The Recyclapedia works to revolutionize recycling by both keeping a counter of how many items have been recycled in a recycling bin as well as giving treats to people for properly recycling.

###**Target Population**

Our product would be best for those who either don't know how recycling works in their area (i.e. your average person) or have never before recycled anything (i.e. primary school children). By using our recyclapedia, they would gain the assistance they need to start helping keep our planet healthy and landfills cleaner.

###**How It Works**

If the user is ever curious about whether or not something is recyclable, they simply walk up with their trash and scan their barcode. If the Recyclapedia has seen the barcode before and knows it is recyclable, it will pulse a green LED, increment the count of recycled items, and will proactively help the user upon them reaching for a Sugary Treat and Reward (STaR). If the system knows that the item is no recyclable, it will simply pulse the red LED. On the item not being known, the blue LED is pulsed and the Recyclapedia waits for the user to press a button corresponding to whether or not that item is recyclable. Once given a response, the Recyclapedia stores this to memory for future use and does the other corresponding actions.
